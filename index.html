<h1>HTML GUIDE BY maxieee0</h1>
	<h2><b>The Basics</b></h2>
	   <section>
	    <p> HTML is not a programming language, it's a <i>markup</i> language. It tells the browser what to do. HTML isn't really that hard, in fact, ChatGPT says it's one of if not the easiest! Let's get it down </p>
		<p> So, let's get over <i>tags</i>. Tags are <b>CRUCIAL</b> for making the site work, and they serve the purpose of helping <i>elements</i>dictate what should be on the HTML file. </p>
	<h3> Here are the top 10 main tags and their meanings!</h3>
            <ol>
        <li>h1...h6 - Headers from 1 to 6, 1 being the biggest.</li>
	<li>section - Tag that sets things apart.</li>
        <li>p - Paragraph (not an actual one, but a wall of words unless you close the tag)</li>
        <li>i - Italicizes a word (e.g. <i>Hello!</i>)</li>
        <li>b - Makes a word bold (e.g. <b>Hi there!</b></li>
        <li>u - Underlines a word (e.g. <u>What's up?</u></li>
        <li>!DOCTYPE html - Tells the site that it's an HTML5 site</li>
        <li>html - Wraps the code content.</li>
        <li>head - Basically the brain of the code of the site.</li>
        <li>title - The text in the browser tab.</li>
        </ol>
        </section>

    <h2>Indents</h2>
  <p><i>Indents</i> are useful in the code for spacing certain elements out, we'll get to elements later. They are extraodinarily helpful for cleaning up jumbled code and giving you the freedom to get a shield from headaches!</p>

<!-- Note to HTML readers, this may be inaccurate, please fix me if you can. -->
       <section>
        <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p><i>Elements</i> are a line or wall (depends on the text style) of bits of the HTML code that tell the browser what it is and show it to the user.

<p> This site is made in HTML5 for reference, and you can inspect element it, do whatever temporary changes you want I guess. Hope this guide helped you out!</p>
